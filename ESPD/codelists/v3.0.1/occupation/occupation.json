Much of their work involves oversight, management and development of the animal collection. Often this is related to animal husbandry and welfare policy, the acquisition and disposition of zoo animals, and development of new exhibits. Zoos normally acquire animals through captive breeding programs. The zoo collection, trade, and transport of the animals is regulated by government agencies as well as guided by zoo membership organisations. Consequently, zoo curators act as a liaison between these agencies and the zoo itself. Additionally, they play an active role in the administration of zoo functions and all kinds of captive breeding programs.",

Zoo educators can be involved in both formal and informal learning opportunities ranging from production of information signs at enclosures to delivering classroom sessions linked to school or university curricula. Depending on the size of the organisation the education team may be a single person or a large team. Consequently the optional skills reqired are very broad and will vary from organisation to organisation.Â  \n \nZoo educators also promote conservation efforts. This can involve work within the zoo but also in the field as part of any zoo outreach project(s).",
